DROP VIEW
DROP VIEW — remove a view
Synopsis
DROP VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
Description
DROP VIEW drops an existing view. To execute this command you must be the owner of the view.
Parameters
IF EXISTS
Do not throw an error if the view does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.
name
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the view to remove.
CASCADE
Automatically drop objects that depend on the view (such as other views), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.15).
RESTRICT
Refuse to drop the view if any objects depend on it. This is the default.
Examples
This command will remove the view called kinds:
DROP VIEW kinds;
Compatibility
This command conforms to the SQL standard, except that the standard only allows one view to be dropped per command, and apart from the IF EXISTS option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
