52.29. pg_language #
The catalog pg_language registers languages in which you can write functions or stored procedures. See CREATE LANGUAGE and Chapter 40 for more information about language handlers.
Table 52.29. pg_language Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
lanname name
Name of the language
lanowner oid (references pg_authid.oid)
Owner of the language
lanispl bool
This is false for internal languages (such as SQL) and true for user-defined languages. Currently, pg_dump still uses this to determine which languages need to be dumped, but this might be replaced by a different mechanism in the future.
lanpltrusted bool
True if this is a trusted language, which means that it is believed not to grant access to anything outside the normal SQL execution environment. Only superusers can create functions in untrusted languages.
lanplcallfoid oid (references pg_proc.oid)
For noninternal languages this references the language handler, which is a special function that is responsible for executing all functions that are written in the particular language. Zero for internal languages.
laninline oid (references pg_proc.oid)
This references a function that is responsible for executing “inline” anonymous code blocks (DO blocks). Zero if inline blocks are not supported.
lanvalidator oid (references pg_proc.oid)
This references a language validator function that is responsible for checking the syntax and validity of new functions when they are created. Zero if no validator is provided.
lanacl aclitem[]
Access privileges; see Section 5.8 for details
