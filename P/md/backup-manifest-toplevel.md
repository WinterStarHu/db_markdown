70.1. Backup Manifest Top-level Object #
The backup manifest JSON document contains the following keys.
PostgreSQL-Backup-Manifest-Version
The associated value is an integer. Beginning in PostgreSQL 17, it is 2; in older versions, it is 1.
System-Identifier
The database system identifier of the PostgreSQL instance where the backup was taken. This field is present only when PostgreSQL-Backup-Manifest-Version is 2.
Files
The associated value is always a list of objects, each describing one file that is present in the backup. No entries are present in this list for the WAL files that are needed in order to use the backup, or for the backup manifest itself. The structure of each object in the list is described in Section 70.2.
WAL-Ranges
The associated value is always a list of objects, each describing a range of WAL records that must be readable from a particular timeline in order to make use of the backup. The structure of these objects is further described in Section 70.3.
Manifest-Checksum
This key is always present on the last line of the backup manifest file. The associated value is a SHA-256 checksum of all the preceding lines. We use a fixed checksum method here to make it possible for clients to do incremental parsing of the manifest. While a SHA-256 checksum is significantly more expensive than a CRC-32C checksum, the manifest should normally be small enough that the extra computation won't matter very much.
