Table of Contents
69.1. Row Estimation Examples

69.2.1. Functional Dependencies
69.2.2. Multivariate N-Distinct Counts
69.2.3. MCV Lists
69.3. Planner Statistics and Security
This chapter builds on the material covered in Section 14.1 and Section 14.2 to show some additional details about how the planner uses the system statistics to estimate the number of rows each part of a query might return. This is a significant part of the planning process, providing much of the raw material for cost calculation.
The intent of this chapter is not to document the code in detail, but to present an overview of how it works. This will perhaps ease the learning curve for someone who subsequently wishes to read the code.
