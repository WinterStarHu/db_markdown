CREATE ACCESS METHOD
CREATE ACCESS METHOD — define a new access method
Synopsis
CREATE ACCESS METHOD name
TYPE access_method_type
HANDLER handler_function
Description
CREATE ACCESS METHOD creates a new access method.
The access method name must be unique within the database.
Only superusers can define new access methods.
Parameters
name
The name of the access method to be created.
access_method_type
This clause specifies the type of access method to define. Only TABLE and INDEX are supported at present.
handler_function
handler_function is the name (possibly schema-qualified) of a previously registered function that represents the access method. The handler function must be declared to take a single argument of type internal, and its return type depends on the type of access method; for TABLE access methods, it must be table_am_handler and for INDEX access methods, it must be index_am_handler. The C-level API that the handler function must implement varies depending on the type of access method. The table access method API is described in Chapter 62 and the index access method API is described in Chapter 63.
Examples
Create an index access method heptree with handler function heptree_handler:
CREATE ACCESS METHOD heptree TYPE INDEX HANDLER heptree_handler;
Compatibility
CREATE ACCESS METHOD is a PostgreSQL extension.
