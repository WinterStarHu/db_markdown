52.44. pg_replication_origin #
The pg_replication_origin catalog contains all replication origins created. For more on replication origins see Chapter 48.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_replication_origin is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only one copy of pg_replication_origin per cluster, not one per database.
