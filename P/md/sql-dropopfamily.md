DROP OPERATOR FAMILY
DROP OPERATOR FAMILY — remove an operator family
Synopsis
DROP OPERATOR FAMILY [ IF EXISTS ] name USING index_method [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
Description
DROP OPERATOR FAMILY drops an existing operator family. To execute this command you must be the owner of the operator family.
DROP OPERATOR FAMILY includes dropping any operator classes contained in the family, but it does not drop any of the operators or functions referenced by the family. If there are any indexes depending on operator classes within the family, you will need to specify CASCADE for the drop to complete.
Parameters
IF EXISTS
Do not throw an error if the operator family does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.
name
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing operator family.
index_method
The name of the index access method the operator family is for.
CASCADE
Automatically drop objects that depend on the operator family, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.15).
RESTRICT
Refuse to drop the operator family if any objects depend on it. This is the default.
Examples
Remove the B-tree operator family float_ops:
DROP OPERATOR FAMILY float_ops USING btree;
This command will not succeed if there are any existing indexes that use operator classes within the family. Add CASCADE to drop such indexes along with the operator family.
Compatibility
There is no DROP OPERATOR FAMILY statement in the SQL standard.
