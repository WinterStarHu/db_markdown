35.19. constraint_table_usage #
The view constraint_table_usage identifies all tables in the current database that are used by some constraint and are owned by a currently enabled role. (This is different from the view table_constraints, which identifies all table constraints along with the table they are defined on.) For a foreign key constraint, this view identifies the table that the foreign key references. For a unique or primary key constraint, this view simply identifies the table the constraint belongs to. Check constraints and not-null constraints are not included in this view.
