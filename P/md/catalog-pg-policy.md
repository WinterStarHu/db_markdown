52.38. pg_policy #
The catalog pg_policy stores row-level security policies for tables. A policy includes the kind of command that it applies to (possibly all commands), the roles that it applies to, the expression to be added as a security-barrier qualification to queries that include the table, and the expression to be added as a WITH CHECK option for queries that attempt to add new records to the table.
Table 52.38. pg_policy Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
polname name
The name of the policy
polrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
The table to which the policy applies
polcmd char
The command type to which the policy is applied: r for SELECT, a for INSERT, w for UPDATE, d for DELETE, or * for all
polpermissive bool
Is the policy permissive or restrictive?
polroles oid[] (references pg_authid.oid)
The roles to which the policy is applied; zero means PUBLIC (and normally appears alone in the array)
polqual pg_node_tree
The expression tree to be added to the security barrier qualifications for queries that use the table
polwithcheck pg_node_tree
The expression tree to be added to the WITH CHECK qualifications for queries that attempt to add rows to the table
Note
Policies stored in pg_policy are applied only when pg_class.relrowsecurity is set for their table.
