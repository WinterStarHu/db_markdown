F.28. pg_logicalinspect — logical decoding components inspection #
F.28.1. Functions
F.28.2. Author
The pg_logicalinspect module provides SQL functions that allow you to inspect the contents of logical decoding components. It allows the inspection of serialized logical snapshots of a running PostgreSQL database cluster, which is useful for debugging or educational purposes.
By default, use of these functions is restricted to superusers and members of the pg_read_server_files role. Access may be granted by superusers to others using GRANT.
F.28.1. Functions #
pg_get_logical_snapshot_meta(filename text) returns record #
Gets logical snapshot metadata about a snapshot file that is located in the server's pg_logical/snapshots directory. The filename argument represents the snapshot file name. For example:
postgres=# SELECT * FROM pg_ls_logicalsnapdir();
-[ RECORD 1 ]+-----------------------
name         | 0-40796E18.snap
size         | 152
modification | 2024-08-14 16:36:32+00
postgres=# SELECT * FROM pg_get_logical_snapshot_meta('0-40796E18.snap');
-[ RECORD 1 ]--------
magic    | 1369563137
checksum | 1028045905
version  | 6
postgres=# SELECT ss.name, meta.* FROM pg_ls_logicalsnapdir() AS ss,
pg_get_logical_snapshot_meta(ss.name) AS meta;
-[ RECORD 1 ]-------------
name     | 0-40796E18.snap
magic    | 1369563137
checksum | 1028045905
version  | 6
If filename does not match a snapshot file, the function raises an error.
pg_get_logical_snapshot_info(filename text) returns record #
Gets logical snapshot information about a snapshot file that is located in the server's pg_logical/snapshots directory. The filename argument represents the snapshot file name. For example:
postgres=# SELECT * FROM pg_ls_logicalsnapdir();
-[ RECORD 1 ]+-----------------------
name         | 0-40796E18.snap
size         | 152
modification | 2024-08-14 16:36:32+00
postgres=# SELECT * FROM pg_get_logical_snapshot_info('0-40796E18.snap');

If filename does not match a snapshot file, the function raises an error.
