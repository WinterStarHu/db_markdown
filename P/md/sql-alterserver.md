ALTER SERVER
ALTER SERVER — change the definition of a foreign server
Synopsis
ALTER SERVER name [ VERSION 'new_version' ]
[ OPTIONS ( [ ADD | SET | DROP ] option ['value'] [, ... ] ) ]
ALTER SERVER name OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
ALTER SERVER name RENAME TO new_name
Description
ALTER SERVER changes the definition of a foreign server. The first form changes the server version string or the generic options of the server (at least one clause is required). The second form changes the owner of the server.
To alter the server you must be the owner of the server. Additionally to alter the owner, you must be able to SET ROLE to the new owning role, and you must have USAGE privilege on the server's foreign-data wrapper. (Note that superusers satisfy all these criteria automatically.)
Parameters
name
The name of an existing server.
new_version
New server version.
OPTIONS ( [ ADD | SET | DROP ] option ['value'] [, ... ] )
Change options for the server. ADD, SET, and DROP specify the action to be performed. ADD is assumed if no operation is explicitly specified. Option names must be unique; names and values are also validated using the server's foreign-data wrapper library.
new_owner
The user name of the new owner of the foreign server.
new_name
The new name for the foreign server.
Examples
Alter server foo, add connection options:
ALTER SERVER foo OPTIONS (host 'foo', dbname 'foodb');
Alter server foo, change version, change host option:
ALTER SERVER foo VERSION '8.4' OPTIONS (SET host 'baz');
Compatibility
ALTER SERVER conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED). The OWNER TO and RENAME forms are PostgreSQL extensions.
