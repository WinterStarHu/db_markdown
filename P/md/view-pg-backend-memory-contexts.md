53.5. pg_backend_memory_contexts #
The view pg_backend_memory_contexts displays all the memory contexts of the server process attached to the current session.
pg_backend_memory_contexts contains one row for each memory context.
Table 53.5. pg_backend_memory_contexts Columns
Column Type
Description
name text
Name of the memory context
ident text
Identification information of the memory context. This field is truncated at 1024 bytes
type text
Type of the memory context
level int4
The 1-based level of the context in the memory context hierarchy. The level of a context also shows the position of that context in the path column.
path int4[]
Array of transient numerical identifiers to describe the memory context hierarchy. The first element is for TopMemoryContext, subsequent elements contain intermediate parents and the final element contains the identifier for the current context.
total_bytes int8
Total bytes allocated for this memory context
total_nblocks int8
Total number of blocks allocated for this memory context
free_bytes int8
Free space in bytes
free_chunks int8
Total number of free chunks
used_bytes int8
Used space in bytes
By default, the pg_backend_memory_contexts view can be read only by superusers or roles with the privileges of the pg_read_all_stats role.
Since memory contexts are created and destroyed during the running of a query, the identifiers stored in the path column can be unstable between multiple invocations of the view in the same query. The example below demonstrates an effective usage of this column and calculates the total number of bytes used by CacheMemoryContext and all of its children:
WITH memory_contexts AS (
SELECT * FROM pg_backend_memory_contexts
)
SELECT sum(c1.total_bytes)
FROM memory_contexts c1, memory_contexts c2
WHERE c2.name = 'CacheMemoryContext'
AND c1.path[c2.level] = c2.path[c2.level];
The Common Table Expression is used to ensure the context IDs in the path column match between both evaluations of the view.
