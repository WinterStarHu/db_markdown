52.9. pg_auth_members #
The catalog pg_auth_members shows the membership relations between roles. Any non-circular set of relationships is allowed.
Because user identities are cluster-wide, pg_auth_members is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only one copy of pg_auth_members per cluster, not one per database.
