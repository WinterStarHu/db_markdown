SPI_cursor_find
SPI_cursor_find — find an existing cursor by name
Synopsis
Portal SPI_cursor_find(const char * name)
Description
SPI_cursor_find finds an existing portal by name. This is primarily useful to resolve a cursor name returned as text by some other function.
Arguments
const char * name
name of the portal
Return Value
pointer to the portal with the specified name, or NULL if none was found
Notes
Beware that this function can return a Portal object that does not have cursor-like properties; for example it might not return tuples. If you simply pass the Portal pointer to other SPI functions, they can defend themselves against such cases, but caution is appropriate when directly inspecting the Portal.
