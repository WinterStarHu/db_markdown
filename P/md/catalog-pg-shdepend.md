52.48. pg_shdepend #
The catalog pg_shdepend records the dependency relationships between database objects and shared objects, such as roles. This information allows PostgreSQL to ensure that those objects are unreferenced before attempting to delete them.
See also pg_depend, which performs a similar function for dependencies involving objects within a single database.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_shdepend is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only one copy of pg_shdepend per cluster, not one per database.
Table 52.48. pg_shdepend Columns
Column Type
Description
dbid oid (references pg_database.oid)
The OID of the database the dependent object is in, or zero for a shared object
classid oid (references pg_class.oid)
The OID of the system catalog the dependent object is in
objid oid (references any OID column)
The OID of the specific dependent object
objsubid int4
For a table column, this is the column number (the objid and classid refer to the table itself). For all other object types, this column is zero.
refclassid oid (references pg_class.oid)
The OID of the system catalog the referenced object is in (must be a shared catalog)
refobjid oid (references any OID column)
The OID of the specific referenced object
deptype char
A code defining the specific semantics of this dependency relationship; see text
In all cases, a pg_shdepend entry indicates that the referenced object cannot be dropped without also dropping the dependent object. However, there are several subflavors identified by deptype:
SHARED_DEPENDENCY_OWNER (o)
The referenced object (which must be a role) is the owner of the dependent object.
SHARED_DEPENDENCY_ACL (a)
The referenced object (which must be a role) is mentioned in the ACL of the dependent object. (A SHARED_DEPENDENCY_ACL entry is not made for the owner of the object, since the owner will have a SHARED_DEPENDENCY_OWNER entry anyway.)
SHARED_DEPENDENCY_INITACL (i)
The referenced object (which must be a role) is mentioned in a pg_init_privs entry for the dependent object.
SHARED_DEPENDENCY_POLICY (r)
The referenced object (which must be a role) is mentioned as the target of a dependent policy object.
SHARED_DEPENDENCY_TABLESPACE (t)
The referenced object (which must be a tablespace) is mentioned as the tablespace for a relation that doesn't have storage.
Other dependency flavors might be needed in future. Note in particular that the current definition only supports roles and tablespaces as referenced objects.
As in the pg_depend catalog, most objects created during initdb are considered “pinned”. No entries are made in pg_shdepend that would have a pinned object as either referenced or dependent object.
