35.55. transforms #
The view transforms contains information about the transforms defined in the current database. More precisely, it contains a row for each function contained in a transform (the “from SQL” or “to SQL” function).
Table 35.53. transforms Columns
Column Type
Description
udt_catalog sql_identifier
Name of the database that contains the type the transform is for (always the current database)
udt_schema sql_identifier
Name of the schema that contains the type the transform is for
udt_name sql_identifier
Name of the type the transform is for
specific_catalog sql_identifier
Name of the database containing the function (always the current database)
specific_schema sql_identifier
Name of the schema containing the function
specific_name sql_identifier
The “specific name” of the function. See Section 35.45 for more information.
group_name sql_identifier
The SQL standard allows defining transforms in “groups”, and selecting a group at run time. PostgreSQL does not support this. Instead, transforms are specific to a language. As a compromise, this field contains the language the transform is for.
transform_type character_data
