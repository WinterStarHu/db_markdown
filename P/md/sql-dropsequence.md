DROP SEQUENCE
DROP SEQUENCE — remove a sequence
Synopsis
DROP SEQUENCE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
Description
DROP SEQUENCE removes sequence number generators. A sequence can only be dropped by its owner or a superuser.
Parameters
IF EXISTS
Do not throw an error if the sequence does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.
name
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a sequence.
CASCADE
Automatically drop objects that depend on the sequence, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.15).
RESTRICT
Refuse to drop the sequence if any objects depend on it. This is the default.
Examples
To remove the sequence serial:
DROP SEQUENCE serial;
Compatibility
DROP SEQUENCE conforms to the SQL standard, except that the standard only allows one sequence to be dropped per command, and apart from the IF EXISTS option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
