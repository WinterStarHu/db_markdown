47.7. Logical Decoding Output Writers #
It is possible to add more output methods for logical decoding. For details, see src/backend/replication/logical/logicalfuncs.c. Essentially, three functions need to be provided: one to read WAL, one to prepare writing output, and one to write the output (see Section 47.6.5).
