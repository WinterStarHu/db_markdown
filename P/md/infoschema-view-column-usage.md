35.63. view_column_usage #
The view view_column_usage identifies all columns that are used in the query expression of a view (the SELECT statement that defines the view). A column is only included if the table that contains the column is owned by a currently enabled role.
Note
Columns of system tables are not included. This should be fixed sometime.
