UNLISTEN
UNLISTEN — stop listening for a notification
Synopsis
UNLISTEN { channel | * }
Description
UNLISTEN is used to remove an existing registration for NOTIFY events. UNLISTEN cancels any existing registration of the current PostgreSQL session as a listener on the notification channel named channel. The special wildcard * cancels all listener registrations for the current session.
NOTIFY contains a more extensive discussion of the use of LISTEN and NOTIFY.
Parameters
channel
Name of a notification channel (any identifier).
*
All current listen registrations for this session are cleared.
Notes
You can unlisten something you were not listening for; no warning or error will appear.
At the end of each session, UNLISTEN * is automatically executed.
A transaction that has executed UNLISTEN cannot be prepared for two-phase commit.
Examples
To make a registration:
LISTEN virtual;
NOTIFY virtual;
Asynchronous notification "virtual" received from server process with PID 8448.
Once UNLISTEN has been executed, further NOTIFY messages will be ignored:
UNLISTEN virtual;
NOTIFY virtual;
-- no NOTIFY event is received
Compatibility
There is no UNLISTEN command in the SQL standard.
