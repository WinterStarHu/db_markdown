DROP LANGUAGE
DROP LANGUAGE — remove a procedural language
Synopsis
DROP [ PROCEDURAL ] LANGUAGE [ IF EXISTS ] name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
Description
DROP LANGUAGE removes the definition of a previously registered procedural language. You must be a superuser or the owner of the language to use DROP LANGUAGE.
Note
As of PostgreSQL 9.1, most procedural languages have been made into “extensions”, and should therefore be removed with DROP EXTENSION not DROP LANGUAGE.
Parameters
IF EXISTS
Do not throw an error if the language does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.
name
The name of an existing procedural language.
CASCADE
Automatically drop objects that depend on the language (such as functions in the language), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.15).
RESTRICT
Refuse to drop the language if any objects depend on it. This is the default.
Examples
This command removes the procedural language plsample:
DROP LANGUAGE plsample;
Compatibility
There is no DROP LANGUAGE statement in the SQL standard.
