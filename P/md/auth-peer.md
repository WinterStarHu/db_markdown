20.9. Peer Authentication #
The peer authentication method works by obtaining the client's operating system user name from the kernel and using it as the allowed database user name (with optional user name mapping). This method is only supported on local connections.
The following configuration options are supported for peer:
map
Allows for mapping between system and database user names. See Section 20.2 for details.
Peer authentication is only available on operating systems providing the getpeereid() function, the SO_PEERCRED socket parameter, or similar mechanisms. Currently that includes Linux, most flavors of BSD including macOS, and Solaris.
