52.54. pg_subscription #
The catalog pg_subscription contains all existing logical replication subscriptions. For more information about logical replication see Chapter 29.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_subscription is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only one copy of pg_subscription per cluster, not one per database.
Access to the column subconninfo is revoked from normal users, because it could contain plain-text passwords.
Table 52.54. pg_subscription Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
subdbid oid (references pg_database.oid)
OID of the database that the subscription resides in
subskiplsn pg_lsn
Finish LSN of the transaction whose changes are to be skipped, if a valid LSN; otherwise 0/0.
subname name
Name of the subscription
subowner oid (references pg_authid.oid)
Owner of the subscription
subenabled bool
If true, the subscription is enabled and should be replicating
subbinary bool
If true, the subscription will request that the publisher send data in binary format
substream char
Controls how to handle the streaming of in-progress transactions: f = disallow streaming of in-progress transactions, t = spill the changes of in-progress transactions to disk and apply at once after the transaction is committed on the publisher and received by the subscriber, p = apply changes directly using a parallel apply worker if available (same as t if no worker is available)
subtwophasestate char
State codes for two-phase mode: d = disabled, p = pending enablement, e = enabled
subdisableonerr bool
If true, the subscription will be disabled if one of its workers detects an error
subpasswordrequired bool
If true, the subscription will be required to specify a password for authentication
subrunasowner bool
If true, the subscription will be run with the permissions of the subscription owner
subfailover bool
If true, the associated replication slots (i.e. the main slot and the table synchronization slots) in the upstream database are enabled to be synchronized to the standbys
subconninfo text
Connection string to the upstream database
subslotname name
Name of the replication slot in the upstream database (also used for the local replication origin name); null represents NONE
subsynccommit text
The synchronous_commit setting for the subscription's workers to use
subpublications text[]
Array of subscribed publication names. These reference publications defined in the upstream database. For more on publications see Section 29.1.
suborigin text
The origin value must be either none or any. The default is any. If none, the subscription will request the publisher to only send changes that don't have an origin. If any, the publisher sends changes regardless of their origin.
