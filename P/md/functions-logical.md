9.1. Logical Operators #
The usual logical operators are available:
boolean AND boolean → boolean
boolean OR boolean → boolean
NOT boolean → boolean
SQL uses a three-valued logic system with true, false, and null, which represents “unknown”. Observe the following truth tables:
a
b
a AND b
a OR b
TRUE
TRUE
TRUE
TRUE
TRUE
FALSE
FALSE
TRUE
TRUE
NULL
NULL
TRUE

FALSE

NOT a
TRUE

NULL
NULL
The operators AND and OR are commutative, that is, you can switch the left and right operands without affecting the result. (However, it is not guaranteed that the left operand is evaluated before the right operand. See Section 4.2.14 for more information about the order of evaluation of subexpressions.)
