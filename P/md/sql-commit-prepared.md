COMMIT PREPARED
COMMIT PREPARED — commit a transaction that was earlier prepared for two-phase commit
Synopsis
COMMIT PREPARED transaction_id
Description
COMMIT PREPARED commits a transaction that is in prepared state.
Parameters
transaction_id
The transaction identifier of the transaction that is to be committed.
Notes
To commit a prepared transaction, you must be either the same user that executed the transaction originally, or a superuser. But you do not have to be in the same session that executed the transaction.
This command cannot be executed inside a transaction block. The prepared transaction is committed immediately.
All currently available prepared transactions are listed in the pg_prepared_xacts system view.
Examples
Commit the transaction identified by the transaction identifier foobar:
COMMIT PREPARED 'foobar';
Compatibility
COMMIT PREPARED is a PostgreSQL extension. It is intended for use by external transaction management systems, some of which are covered by standards (such as X/Open XA), but the SQL side of those systems is not standardized.
