DROP POLICY
DROP POLICY — remove a row-level security policy from a table
Synopsis
DROP POLICY [ IF EXISTS ] name ON table_name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
Description
DROP POLICY removes the specified policy from the table. Note that if the last policy is removed for a table and the table still has row-level security enabled via ALTER TABLE, then the default-deny policy will be used. ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY can be used to disable row-level security for a table, whether policies for the table exist or not.
Parameters
IF EXISTS
Do not throw an error if the policy does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.
name
The name of the policy to drop.
table_name
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table that the policy is on.
CASCADERESTRICT
These key words do not have any effect, since there are no dependencies on policies.
Examples
To drop the policy called p1 on the table named my_table:
DROP POLICY p1 ON my_table;
Compatibility
DROP POLICY is a PostgreSQL extension.
