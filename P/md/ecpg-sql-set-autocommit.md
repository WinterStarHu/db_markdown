SET AUTOCOMMIT
SET AUTOCOMMIT — set the autocommit behavior of the current session
Synopsis
SET AUTOCOMMIT { = | TO } { ON | OFF }
Description
SET AUTOCOMMIT sets the autocommit behavior of the current database session. By default, embedded SQL programs are not in autocommit mode, so COMMIT needs to be issued explicitly when desired. This command can change the session to autocommit mode, where each individual statement is committed implicitly.
Compatibility
SET AUTOCOMMIT is an extension of PostgreSQL ECPG.
