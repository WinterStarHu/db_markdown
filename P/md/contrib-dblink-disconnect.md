dblink_disconnect — closes a persistent connection to a remote database
Synopsis
dblink_disconnect() returns text
dblink_disconnect(text connname) returns text
Description
dblink_disconnect() closes a connection previously opened by dblink_connect(). The form with no arguments closes an unnamed connection.

SELECT dblink_disconnect('myconn');
dblink_disconnect
-------------------
