COMMIT
COMMIT — commit the current transaction
Synopsis
COMMIT [ WORK | TRANSACTION ] [ AND [ NO ] CHAIN ]
Description
COMMIT commits the current transaction. All changes made by the transaction become visible to others and are guaranteed to be durable if a crash occurs.
Parameters
WORKTRANSACTION #
Optional key words. They have no effect.
AND CHAIN #
If AND CHAIN is specified, a new transaction is immediately started with the same transaction characteristics (see SET TRANSACTION) as the just finished one. Otherwise, no new transaction is started.
Notes
Use ROLLBACK to abort a transaction.
Issuing COMMIT when not inside a transaction does no harm, but it will provoke a warning message. COMMIT AND CHAIN when not inside a transaction is an error.
Examples
To commit the current transaction and make all changes permanent:
COMMIT;
Compatibility
The command COMMIT conforms to the SQL standard. The form COMMIT TRANSACTION is a PostgreSQL extension.
