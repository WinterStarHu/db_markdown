dblink is a module that supports connections to other PostgreSQL databases from within a database session.
dblink can report the following wait events under the wait event type Extension.
DblinkConnect
Waiting to establish a connection to a remote server.
DblinkGetConnect
Waiting to establish a connection to a remote server when it could not be found in the list of already-opened connections.
DblinkGetResult
Waiting to receive the results of a query from a remote server.
See also postgres_fdw, which provides roughly the same functionality using a more modern and standards-compliant infrastructure.
