SPI_execute_plan
SPI_execute_plan — execute a statement prepared by SPI_prepare
Synopsis
int SPI_execute_plan(SPIPlanPtr plan, Datum * values, const char * nulls,
bool read_only, long count)
Description
SPI_execute_plan executes a statement prepared by SPI_prepare or one of its siblings. read_only and count have the same interpretation as in SPI_execute.
Arguments
SPIPlanPtr plan
prepared statement (returned by SPI_prepare)
Datum * values
An array of actual parameter values. Must have same length as the statement's number of arguments.
const char * nulls
An array describing which parameters are null. Must have same length as the statement's number of arguments.
If nulls is NULL then SPI_execute_plan assumes that no parameters are null. Otherwise, each entry of the nulls array should be ' ' if the corresponding parameter value is non-null, or 'n' if the corresponding parameter value is null. (In the latter case, the actual value in the corresponding values entry doesn't matter.) Note that nulls is not a text string, just an array: it does not need a '\0' terminator.
bool read_only
true for read-only execution
long count
maximum number of rows to return, or 0 for no limit
Return Value
The return value is the same as for SPI_execute, with the following additional possible error (negative) results:
SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT
if plan is NULL or invalid, or count is less than 0
SPI_ERROR_PARAM
if values is NULL and plan was prepared with some parameters
SPI_processed and SPI_tuptable are set as in SPI_execute if successful.
