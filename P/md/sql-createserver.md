CREATE SERVER
CREATE SERVER — define a new foreign server
Synopsis
CREATE SERVER [ IF NOT EXISTS ] server_name [ TYPE 'server_type' ] [ VERSION 'server_version' ]
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER fdw_name
[ OPTIONS ( option 'value' [, ... ] ) ]
Description
CREATE SERVER defines a new foreign server. The user who defines the server becomes its owner.
A foreign server typically encapsulates connection information that a foreign-data wrapper uses to access an external data resource. Additional user-specific connection information may be specified by means of user mappings.
The server name must be unique within the database.
Creating a server requires USAGE privilege on the foreign-data wrapper being used.
Parameters
IF NOT EXISTS
Do not throw an error if a server with the same name already exists. A notice is issued in this case. Note that there is no guarantee that the existing server is anything like the one that would have been created.
server_name
The name of the foreign server to be created.
server_type
Optional server type, potentially useful to foreign-data wrappers.
server_version
Optional server version, potentially useful to foreign-data wrappers.
fdw_name
The name of the foreign-data wrapper that manages the server.
OPTIONS ( option 'value' [, ... ] )
This clause specifies the options for the server. The options typically define the connection details of the server, but the actual names and values are dependent on the server's foreign-data wrapper.
Notes
When using the dblink module, a foreign server's name can be used as an argument of the dblink_connect function to indicate the connection parameters. It is necessary to have the USAGE privilege on the foreign server to be able to use it in this way.
If the foreign server supports sort pushdown, it is necessary for it to have the same sort ordering as the local server.
Examples
Create a server myserver that uses the foreign-data wrapper postgres_fdw:
CREATE SERVER myserver FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw OPTIONS (host 'foo', dbname 'foodb', port '5432');
See postgres_fdw for more details.
Compatibility
CREATE SERVER conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED).
