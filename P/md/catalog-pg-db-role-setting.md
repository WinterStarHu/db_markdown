52.16. pg_db_role_setting #
The catalog pg_db_role_setting records the default values that have been set for run-time configuration variables, for each role and database combination.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_db_role_setting is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only one copy of pg_db_role_setting per cluster, not one per database.
