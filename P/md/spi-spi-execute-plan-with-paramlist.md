SPI_execute_plan_with_paramlist — execute a statement prepared by SPI_prepare
Synopsis
int SPI_execute_plan_with_paramlist(SPIPlanPtr plan,
ParamListInfo params,
bool read_only,
long count)
Description
SPI_execute_plan_with_paramlist executes a statement prepared by SPI_prepare. This function is equivalent to SPI_execute_plan except that information about the parameter values to be passed to the query is presented differently. The ParamListInfo representation can be convenient for passing down values that are already available in that format. It also supports use of dynamic parameter sets via hook functions specified in ParamListInfo.
This function is now deprecated in favor of SPI_execute_plan_extended.
Arguments
SPIPlanPtr plan
prepared statement (returned by SPI_prepare)
ParamListInfo params
data structure containing parameter types and values; NULL if none
bool read_only
true for read-only execution
long count
maximum number of rows to return, or 0 for no limit
Return Value
The return value is the same as for SPI_execute_plan.
SPI_processed and SPI_tuptable are set as in SPI_execute_plan if successful.
