52.22. pg_extension #
The catalog pg_extension stores information about the installed extensions. See Section 36.17 for details about extensions.
Table 52.22. pg_extension Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
extname name
Name of the extension
extowner oid (references pg_authid.oid)
Owner of the extension
extnamespace oid (references pg_namespace.oid)
Schema containing the extension's exported objects
extrelocatable bool
True if extension can be relocated to another schema
extversion text
Version name for the extension
extconfig oid[] (references pg_class.oid)
Array of regclass OIDs for the extension's configuration table(s), or NULL if none
extcondition text[]
Array of WHERE-clause filter conditions for the extension's configuration table(s), or NULL if none
Note that unlike most catalogs with a “namespace” column, extnamespace is not meant to imply that the extension belongs to that schema. Extension names are never schema-qualified. Rather, extnamespace indicates the schema that contains most or all of the extension's objects. If extrelocatable is true, then this schema must in fact contain all schema-qualifiable objects belonging to the extension.
