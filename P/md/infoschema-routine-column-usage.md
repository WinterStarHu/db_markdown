35.40. routine_column_usage #
The view routine_column_usage identifies all columns that are used by a function or procedure, either in the SQL body or in parameter default expressions. (This only works for unquoted SQL bodies, not quoted bodies or functions in other languages.) A column is only included if its table is owned by a currently enabled role.
