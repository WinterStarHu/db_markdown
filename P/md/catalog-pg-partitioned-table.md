52.37. pg_partitioned_table #
The catalog pg_partitioned_table stores information about how tables are partitioned.
Table 52.37. pg_partitioned_table Columns
Column Type
Description
partrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
The OID of the pg_class entry for this partitioned table
partstrat char
Partitioning strategy; h = hash partitioned table, l = list partitioned table, r = range partitioned table
partnatts int2
The number of columns in the partition key
partdefid oid (references pg_class.oid)
The OID of the pg_class entry for the default partition of this partitioned table, or zero if this partitioned table does not have a default partition
partattrs int2vector (references pg_attribute.attnum)
This is an array of partnatts values that indicate which table columns are part of the partition key. For example, a value of 1 3 would mean that the first and the third table columns make up the partition key. A zero in this array indicates that the corresponding partition key column is an expression, rather than a simple column reference.
partclass oidvector (references pg_opclass.oid)
For each column in the partition key, this contains the OID of the operator class to use. See pg_opclass for details.
partcollation oidvector (references pg_collation.oid)
For each column in the partition key, this contains the OID of the collation to use for partitioning, or zero if the column is not of a collatable data type.
partexprs pg_node_tree
Expression trees (in nodeToString() representation) for partition key columns that are not simple column references. This is a list with one element for each zero entry in partattrs. Null if all partition key columns are simple references.
