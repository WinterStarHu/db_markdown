35.9. check_constraints #
The view check_constraints contains all check constraints, either defined on a table or on a domain, that are owned by a currently enabled role. (The owner of the table or domain is the owner of the constraint.)
The SQL standard considers not-null constraints to be check constraints with a CHECK (column_name IS NOT NULL) expression. So not-null constraints are also included here and don't have a separate view.
