SPI_cursor_fetch — fetch some rows from a cursor
Synopsis
void SPI_cursor_fetch(Portal portal, bool forward, long count)

SPI_cursor_fetch fetches some rows from a cursor. This is equivalent to a subset of the SQL command FETCH (see SPI_scroll_cursor_fetch for more functionality).
Arguments
Portal portal
portal containing the cursor
bool forward
true for fetch forward, false for fetch backward
long count
maximum number of rows to fetch
Return Value
SPI_processed and SPI_tuptable are set as in SPI_execute if successful.
Notes
Fetching backward may fail if the cursor's plan was not created with the CURSOR_OPT_SCROLL option.
