Part III. Server Administration
This part covers topics that are of interest to a PostgreSQL administrator. This includes installation, configuration of the server, management of users and databases, and maintenance tasks. Anyone running PostgreSQL server, even for personal use, but especially in production, should be familiar with these topics.
The information attempts to be in the order in which a new user should read it. The chapters are self-contained and can be read individually as desired. The information is presented in a narrative form in topical units. Readers looking for a complete description of a command are encouraged to review the Part VI.
The first few chapters are written so they can be understood without prerequisite knowledge, so new users who need to set up their own server can begin their exploration. The rest of this part is about tuning and management; that material assumes that the reader is familiar with the general use of the PostgreSQL database system. Readers are encouraged review the Part I and Part II parts for additional information.
