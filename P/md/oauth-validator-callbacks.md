50.3. OAuth Validator Callbacks #
50.3.1. Startup Callback
50.3.2. Validate Callback
50.3.3. Shutdown Callback
OAuth validator modules implement their functionality by defining a set of callbacks. The server will call them as required to process the authentication request from the user.
50.3.1. Startup Callback #
The startup_cb callback is executed directly after loading the module. This callback can be used to set up local state and perform additional initialization if required. If the validator module has state it can use state->private_data to store it.
typedef void (*ValidatorStartupCB) (ValidatorModuleState *state);
50.3.2. Validate Callback #
The validate_cb callback is executed during the OAuth exchange when a user attempts to authenticate using OAuth. Any state set in previous calls will be available in state->private_data.
typedef bool (*ValidatorValidateCB) (const ValidatorModuleState *state,
const char *token, const char *role,
ValidatorModuleResult *result);
token will contain the bearer token to validate. PostgreSQL has ensured that the token is well-formed syntactically, but no other validation has been performed. role will contain the role the user has requested to log in as. The callback must set output parameters in the result struct, which is defined as below:
typedef struct ValidatorModuleResult
{
bool        authorized;
char       *authn_id;
} ValidatorModuleResult;
The connection will only proceed if the module sets result->authorized to true. To authenticate the user, the authenticated user name (as determined using the token) shall be palloc'd and returned in the result->authn_id field. Alternatively, result->authn_id may be set to NULL if the token is valid but the associated user identity cannot be determined.
A validator may return false to signal an internal error, in which case any result parameters are ignored and the connection fails. Otherwise the validator should return true to indicate that it has processed the token and made an authorization decision.
The behavior after validate_cb returns depends on the specific HBA setup. Normally, the result->authn_id user name must exactly match the role that the user is logging in as. (This behavior may be modified with a usermap.) But when authenticating against an HBA rule with delegate_ident_mapping turned on, PostgreSQL will not perform any checks on the value of result->authn_id at all; in this case it is up to the validator to ensure that the token carries enough privileges for the user to log in under the indicated role.
50.3.3. Shutdown Callback #
The shutdown_cb callback is executed when the server backend has finished validating tokens for the connection. If the validator module has any allocated state, this callback should free it to avoid resource leaks.
typedef void (*ValidatorShutdownCB) (ValidatorModuleState *state);
