CLOSE
CLOSE — close a cursor
Synopsis
CLOSE { name | ALL }
Description
CLOSE frees the resources associated with an open cursor. After the cursor is closed, no subsequent operations are allowed on it. A cursor should be closed when it is no longer needed.
Every non-holdable open cursor is implicitly closed when a transaction is terminated by COMMIT or ROLLBACK. A holdable cursor is implicitly closed if the transaction that created it aborts via ROLLBACK. If the creating transaction successfully commits, the holdable cursor remains open until an explicit CLOSE is executed, or the client disconnects.
Parameters
name
The name of an open cursor to close.
ALL
Close all open cursors.
Notes
PostgreSQL does not have an explicit OPEN cursor statement; a cursor is considered open when it is declared. Use the DECLARE statement to declare a cursor.
You can see all available cursors by querying the pg_cursors system view.
If a cursor is closed after a savepoint which is later rolled back, the CLOSE is not rolled back; that is, the cursor remains closed.
Examples
Close the cursor liahona:
CLOSE liahona;
Compatibility
CLOSE is fully conforming with the SQL standard. CLOSE ALL is a PostgreSQL extension.
