53.18. pg_publication_tables #
The view pg_publication_tables provides information about the mapping between publications and information of tables they contain. Unlike the underlying catalog pg_publication_rel, this view expands publications defined as FOR ALL TABLES and FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA, so for such publications there will be a row for each eligible table.
