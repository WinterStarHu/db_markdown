SPI_register_trigger_data — make ephemeral trigger data available in SPI queries
Synopsis
int SPI_register_trigger_data(TriggerData *tdata)
Description
SPI_register_trigger_data makes any ephemeral relations captured by a trigger available to queries planned and executed through the current SPI connection. Currently, this means the transition tables captured by an AFTER trigger defined with a REFERENCING OLD/NEW TABLE AS ... clause. This function should be called by a PL trigger handler function after connecting.
Arguments
TriggerData *tdata
the TriggerData object passed to a trigger handler function as fcinfo->context
Return Value
If the execution of the command was successful then the following (nonnegative) value will be returned:
SPI_OK_TD_REGISTER
if the captured trigger data (if any) has been successfully registered
On error, one of the following negative values is returned:
SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT
if tdata is NULL
SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED
if called from an unconnected C function
SPI_ERROR_REL_DUPLICATE
if the name of any trigger data transient relation is already registered for this connection
