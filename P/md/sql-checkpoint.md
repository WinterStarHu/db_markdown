CHECKPOINT — force a write-ahead log checkpoint
Synopsis
CHECKPOINT
Description
A checkpoint is a point in the write-ahead log sequence at which all data files have been updated to reflect the information in the log. All data files will be flushed to disk. Refer to Section 28.5 for more details about what happens during a checkpoint.
The CHECKPOINT command forces an immediate checkpoint when the command is issued, without waiting for a regular checkpoint scheduled by the system (controlled by the settings in Section 19.5.2). CHECKPOINT is not intended for use during normal operation.
If executed during recovery, the CHECKPOINT command will force a restartpoint (see Section 28.5) rather than writing a new checkpoint.
Only superusers or users with the privileges of the pg_checkpoint role can call CHECKPOINT.
Compatibility
The CHECKPOINT command is a PostgreSQL language extension.
