52.36. pg_parameter_acl #
The catalog pg_parameter_acl records configuration parameters for which privileges have been granted to one or more roles. No entry is made for parameters that have default privileges.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_parameter_acl is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only one copy of pg_parameter_acl per cluster, not one per database.
