18.12. Registering Event Log on Windows #
To register a Windows event log library with the operating system, issue this command:
regsvr32 pgsql_library_directory/pgevent.dll
This creates registry entries used by the event viewer, under the default event source named PostgreSQL.
To specify a different event source name (see event_source), use the /n and /i options:
regsvr32 /n /i:event_source_name pgsql_library_directory/pgevent.dll
To unregister the event log library from the operating system, issue this command:
regsvr32 /u [/i:event_source_name] pgsql_library_directory/pgevent.dll
Note
To enable event logging in the database server, modify log_destination to include eventlog in postgresql.conf.
