ALTER LARGE OBJECT
ALTER LARGE OBJECT — change the definition of a large object
Synopsis
ALTER LARGE OBJECT large_object_oid OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
Description
ALTER LARGE OBJECT changes the definition of a large object.
You must own the large object to use ALTER LARGE OBJECT. To alter the owner, you must also be able to SET ROLE to the new owning role. (However, a superuser can alter any large object anyway.) Currently, the only functionality is to assign a new owner, so both restrictions always apply.
Parameters
large_object_oid
OID of the large object to be altered
new_owner
The new owner of the large object
Compatibility
There is no ALTER LARGE OBJECT statement in the SQL standard.
