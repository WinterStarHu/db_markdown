SPI_modifytuple
SPI_modifytuple — create a row by replacing selected fields of a given row
Synopsis
HeapTuple SPI_modifytuple(Relation rel, HeapTuple row, int ncols,
int * colnum, Datum * values, const char * nulls)
Description
SPI_modifytuple creates a new row by substituting new values for selected columns, copying the original row's columns at other positions. The input row is not modified. The new row is returned in the upper executor context.
This function can only be used while connected to SPI. Otherwise, it returns NULL and sets SPI_result to SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED.
Arguments
Relation rel
Used only as the source of the row descriptor for the row. (Passing a relation rather than a row descriptor is a misfeature.)
HeapTuple row
row to be modified
int ncols
number of columns to be changed
int * colnum
an array of length ncols, containing the numbers of the columns that are to be changed (column numbers start at 1)
Datum * values
an array of length ncols, containing the new values for the specified columns
const char * nulls
an array of length ncols, describing which new values are null
If nulls is NULL then SPI_modifytuple assumes that no new values are null. Otherwise, each entry of the nulls array should be ' ' if the corresponding new value is non-null, or 'n' if the corresponding new value is null. (In the latter case, the actual value in the corresponding values entry doesn't matter.) Note that nulls is not a text string, just an array: it does not need a '\0' terminator.
Return Value
new row with modifications, allocated in the upper executor context, or NULL on error (see SPI_result for an error indication)
On error, SPI_result is set as follows:
SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT
if rel is NULL, or if row is NULL, or if ncols is less than or equal to 0, or if colnum is NULL, or if values is NULL.
SPI_ERROR_NOATTRIBUTE
if colnum contains an invalid column number (less than or equal to 0 or greater than the number of columns in row)
SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED
if SPI is not active
