ALTER OPERATOR CLASS
ALTER OPERATOR CLASS — change the definition of an operator class
Synopsis
ALTER OPERATOR CLASS name USING index_method
RENAME TO new_name
ALTER OPERATOR CLASS name USING index_method
OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
ALTER OPERATOR CLASS name USING index_method
SET SCHEMA new_schema
Description
ALTER OPERATOR CLASS changes the definition of an operator class.
You must own the operator class to use ALTER OPERATOR CLASS. To alter the owner, you must be able to SET ROLE to the new owning role, and that role must have CREATE privilege on the operator class's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the operator class. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any operator class anyway.)
Parameters
name
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing operator class.
index_method
The name of the index method this operator class is for.
new_name
The new name of the operator class.
new_owner
The new owner of the operator class.
new_schema
The new schema for the operator class.
Compatibility
There is no ALTER OPERATOR CLASS statement in the SQL standard.
