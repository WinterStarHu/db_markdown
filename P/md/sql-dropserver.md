DROP SERVER
DROP SERVER — remove a foreign server descriptor
Synopsis
DROP SERVER [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
Description
DROP SERVER removes an existing foreign server descriptor. To execute this command, the current user must be the owner of the server.
Parameters
IF EXISTS
Do not throw an error if the server does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.
name
The name of an existing server.
CASCADE
Automatically drop objects that depend on the server (such as user mappings), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.15).
RESTRICT
Refuse to drop the server if any objects depend on it. This is the default.
Examples
Drop a server foo if it exists:
DROP SERVER IF EXISTS foo;
Compatibility
DROP SERVER conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED). The IF EXISTS clause is a PostgreSQL extension.
